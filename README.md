# AI Quizzer

AI Quizzer is a Flutter application that leverages the power of generative AI to create personalized quizzes on any topic. It uses a spaced repetition algorithm to help you learn and retain information more effectively.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Quiz Generation:** Create quizzes on any topic you want to learn. Just enter a topic and a difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced), and the app will generate a set of quiz cards for you.
*   **Spaced Repetition Learning:** The app uses a spaced repetition algorithm to determine when you should review each card. This helps you focus on the cards you're about to forget and remember information for longer.
*   **Chat with an AI Tutor:** If you're struggling with a question, you can chat with an AI tutor to get a better explanation. The tutor can explain the concept in simpler terms, provide real-world examples, and more.
*   **Customizable Settings:** You can customize the app to your liking, including changing the theme to dark mode, setting your Gemini API key, and choosing the Gemini model you want to use.
*   **Data Persistence:** Your knowledge bases and quiz cards are saved to your device, so you can pick up where you left off.
